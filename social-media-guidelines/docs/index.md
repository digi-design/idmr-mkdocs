# Welcome to <!--*ThePatternOfEverything&trade;*--> Social Media Guidelines

<p style="text-align:center;color:maroon;background-color:yellow"><b><i>Confidential & Proprietary: Not for External Distribution</b></i></p>

The intended audience are all those that seek to teach, preach, and distribute branch school lectures online. The Founder, Dr. Henry Clifford Kinley, was very specific on the mission of the school and the manner in which the gospel would be distributed to the general public. 

The purpose of this guideline is to generate reflection on how the Internet and Social Media platforms may be used, and to raise awareness of certain standards and public relation strategies to continue to improve content and protect all those involved in the creation and distribution of said-content.
 
The Internet, and specifically Social Media (i.e. YouTube), are revolutionary, most notably in their utility for reaching a wide audience at a very affordable cost. With any technology, it’s important to recognize that there are pros, cons and limitations. It’s not as simple as just connecting a camera to the Internet. 

Given the recent tensions in religious and secular communities, it would be worthwhile to pause and reflect deeply on the following recommendations and stimulate introspection.

  <li><p><b><i>What valid concerns and criticisms have members made and what has been done to address those concerns?</i></b></p>

  <p>There are many serious considerations that should be weighed when publishing content online. Failing to fully enumerate and provide guidance and clarity will foster mistrust and suspicion of malintent.</p>  
  
  <p>Many unique challenges and considerations may not be readily apparent in the traditional classroom model. The following survey will help to shed some light on such challenges in regards to online classroom instruction.</p>
